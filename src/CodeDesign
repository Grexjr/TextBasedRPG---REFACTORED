Enemies:

Similar to battle action, these will be enum-based.
Each enum will contain the growth factors of each stat, and in the enemy class, there will be the basic formulas for
stats for all enemies. They will use these base values to calculate enemy stats.



ROOMS:

Will use a graph, with a map to represent all the world that room A is connected to (interestingly, is O(1) rather than
O(n), since arrayList you will have to go through the entire thing.
Will need a DungeonManager for room traversal. Handles between room traversal, room generation, etc.
