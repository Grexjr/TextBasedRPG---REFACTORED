ISSUES:

When enemy is dead, the selection process still continues; not properly exiting battle


TODO:

1. Change defense to be a bit less overpowered
--- Add temporary stats to Entities that get changed when certain things are done--i.e. defending multiple times
--- Make attacks break defenses--more complex later, but for now just subtracts from the temp defense

2. Add randomly selected enemies between 3

3. Refactor the choose target method, removing some nesting, making the loops more efficient

4. Find out why the program is still running after the battle is over; what while loop is unchecked?
