ISSUES:

When enemy is dead, the selection process still continues; not properly exiting battle


TODO:

1. Make damage more complex (create a damage curve based on defense rather than flat subtraction. Also add breaking
defense by attacking (each attack subtracts temporary defense, even into negative, for combo breaks)). Also add piercing
to weaponry to bypass some defense, or destroy defense better.

2. Add randomly selected enemies between 3

3. Refactor the choose target method, removing some nesting, making the loops more efficient

4. Find out why the program is still running after the battle is over; what while loop is unchecked?
