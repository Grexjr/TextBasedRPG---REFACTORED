ISSUES:

When enemy is dead, the selection process still continues; not properly exiting battle


TODO:

1. Change defense to be a bit less overpowered
--- Add temporary stats to Entities that get changed when certain things are done--i.e. defending multiple times
--- Make attacks break defenses--more complex later, but for now just subtracts from the temp defense

2. Add actual enemies, and figure out how to store their data -- enum? JSON? I think enum at first, then individual
methods within the enemy object classes that determine their stats based on the enum base levels.
--- Add 3 enemies that are randomly selected at the start of the battle.

3. Refactor the choose target method, removing some nesting, making the loops more efficient
