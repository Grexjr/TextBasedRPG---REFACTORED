AP Will recover by a set amount each turn, but can be increased by certain actions

Every encounter starts with 0 AP on both sides; but if one side surprises the other, they get 5 AP.

Before an encounter, get chance to surprise; rolls a dice if successful? but if you fail, the enemy gets 5 AP...
-- It's hard to add gameplay to a text based game that isnt chance and strategy-- but it does at least add some risk
and reward behavior, based on player health etc.
